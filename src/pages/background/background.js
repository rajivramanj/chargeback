                        End-to-end tests are key to ensuring we deliver the kind of robust, high quality and usable software necessary to compete at the highest level and accelerate the growth of our company.

                        Its downside can be summed up in a single word, COST. With its extreme setup and overall control and monitoring requirements, Automation Testing is easily the most expensive and time-consuming software quality test method.
